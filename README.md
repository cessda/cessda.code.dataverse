# SUPER DADA

> #### <em>for Dataverse version 4.20</em>

SUPER DADA is a bash script that adapts XML-DDI metadata files produced by Dataverse in order to make them compliant with the technical requirements of the [CESSDA Data Catalogue](https://datacatalogue.cessda.eu/) (CDC).

'SUPER DADA' stands for **S**cript for **Up**dating **E**lectronic **R**ecords: From **Da**taverse to CESS**DA**.

This version of the script is geared towards **version 4.20** of Dataverse.

The script was developed and documented in April-May 2021 by Youssef Ouahalou with the help of Benjamin Peuch for the [SODHA repository](https://www.sodha.be/) at the [State Archives of Belgium](http://www.arch.be/index.php?l=en).

## Prerequisites

Because this script is tailored for Dataverse, you need to run it on **Linux CentOS 7**.

Place the script anywhere on the server where you have installed Dataverse, preferably in the GlassFish directory.

The user which shall run the script must have **access to the folders** in which the export metadata files are stored.

The script relies heavily on **[XMLStarlet](http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/)**, a set of command line utilities for editing XML files which you will need to download and install.

The script will fetch the export metadata files where they are created with **default file storage**, i.e. "file (Default)." Adjustments might be required with other storage modes (AWS, etc.).

## What it does

In its current state, SUPER DADA modifies XML-DDI files produced by a version 4.20 Dataverse installation so that they become fully compliant with the 'BASIC' level of validation (or 'validation gate') of the [CESSDA Metadata Validator](https://cmv.cessda.eu/#!validation).

<span style="color:red">**WARNING: This script <u>overwrites</u> the contents of metadata export files. It does not create separate, edited copies of the files. Consider making an apart backup of your metadata before running the script.**</span>

As per the CDC requirements, which stem from the [CESSDA Metadata Model](https://zenodo.org/record/3547513), SUPER DADA adds

- **elements**
  - ``<holdings>``
  - ``<distDate>``

- and **attributes**
  - ``xml:lang``
  - ``lang``
  - ``vocab``

which are either not present by default in the DDI files produced by Dataverse or not present at the right place according to CDC specifications.

## Two steps

First, you will need to run the script without the **``-mtime`` parameter** in order to edit all of your metadata export files.

Then you can set it to run periodically with said parameter so that only the most recent files are modified (see comments in the code).

## Version history and project status

This is the **first version** of SUPER DADA: **v1.0**

The script will likely be adapted to retain compatibility with versions 5+ of Dataverse in the future.
